# Full Auto CI - Development Context

## Current Status

- Initial project structure created
- Core service implementation started
- CLI interface implemented
- API skeleton in place
- Tool modules for Pylint and Coverage created
- Basic unit tests written

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 (Current Focus)

- [x] Complete Git integration
  - [x] Implement repository cloning
  - [x] Add commit detection and tracking
  - [x] Add webhook support for automatic triggers

- [x] Enhance SQLite database
  - [x] Add proper migrations system *(basic column backfill helpers in service setup)*
  - [x] Implement data access layers *(see `src/db.py`, `CIService` refactor)*
  - [x] Add indexes for performance

- [ ] Complete CLI functionality
  - [x] Add configuration commands *(new `config` subcommands for show/set/path)*
  - [x] Add user management *(new `user` add/list/remove commands backed by service)*
  - [ ] Implement better output formatting

- [ ] Improve test coverage
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests

### Phase 2 (Coming Soon)

- [ ] Implement Flask web dashboard
  - [ ] Set up basic Flask application
  - [ ] Create dashboard templates with Jinja2
  - [ ] Add HTMX for dynamic content
  - [ ] Implement authentication and session management

- [ ] Add visualization for test results
  - [ ] Historical trends
  - [ ] Commit-by-commit comparison

### Phase 3 (Future)

- [ ] Add support for additional languages
  - [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript
  - [ ] Rust
  - [ ] Go
  - [ ] Java

- [ ] Implement notification system
  - [ ] Email notifications
  - [ ] Slack integration
  - [ ] Custom webhooks

## Technical Debt

- API module needs Flask implementation
- Error handling needs improvement
- Configuration management is basic
- Missing comprehensive logging
- No automated deployment pipeline

## Development Environment

The project now uses a VS Code Dev Container for consistent development environments:

- Docker-based development environment
- Pre-configured with all necessary dependencies
- Automatic initialization of database and config
- Standardized code formatting and linting

To use:

1. Install Docker and VS Code with Remote Containers extension
2. Open project folder in VS Code
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. Environment is automatically initialized
